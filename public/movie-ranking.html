<h1> The Best Anime Of All Time</h1>
<h2> Here are my top 3 best anime.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1. JJK</h3>
<p> Jujutsu Kaisen stands out in the Shonen genre with its commitment to exploring complex subjects and psychological depth, adding intellectual depth to the narrative.
    The animation in Jujutsu Kaisen is praised for its fluidity and visual brilliance, rivaling other top Shonen anime series.
    Unlike many Shonen anime, Jujutsu Kaisen does not shy away from addressing real-life themes such as discrimination, while also avoiding cliche romance and showcasing a strong female cast.</p>
<h3> 2. One Piece</h3>
<p> Eiichiro Oda's One Piece is one of the most popular shonen series in anime history. One Piece’s incredible popularity positioned it as a part of the previous “Big Three.” The story follows Monkey D. Luffy on his journey to fulfill his dream of becoming the Pirate King.</p>
<h3>3. Dragon Ball-Z</h3>
<p> That said, there’s really no denying the sheer quality of Dragon Ball Z. This was the second anime dedicated to adapting one of the greatest battle manga of all time— and while messy, it did do a pretty good job all around. Dragon Ball Z is the better series overall, but Super does outdo it every now and then.</p>
